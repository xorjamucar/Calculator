Functionality:
input stats at 0
operation starts as empty string

	1. individual tests from reset:
		1.1 enter number "x"
			input must be x
			operation must be empty string
		1.2 enter number "x" and enter "=":
			input must be "x"
			operation should be: "x =";
		1.3 enter number "x" and enter operand "y"
			input must be "x"
			operation must be "x y":
		1.4 enter a number "x", enter operand "y"  and enter "=":
			input must be result from operation "x y x"
			operation must be "x y x ="
		1.4 enter number "x", enter operand "y" and enter number "z"
			input must be "z"
			operation must be "x y"
		1.6 enter a number "x", enter operand "y", enter number "z" and enter "=":
			input must be result from operation "x y z"
			operation must be "x y z ="
		1.7 enter a number "x", enter operand "y", enter number "z" and enter operand "q":
			input must be result from operation "x y z" 
			operation must be "input q"

	2. continuity of tests from previous tests without combinations:
		2.1 do 1.1, enter another number "y":
			input must be x*10+y
			operation must be empty string
			this is the expected behaiviour on all inputs that are non decimal
		2.2 do 1.2, enter number "y" and enter "=":
			input must be "y"
			operation must be "y ="
		2.3
